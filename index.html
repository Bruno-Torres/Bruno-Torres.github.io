        <p>Welcome To My Page.</p>

<p>./ Introduction</p>

<p>Hello my name is Bruno and I'm interested in computers and programming. I like to do level design and make sounds and music.</p>

<p>./ What I'm working on.</p>

<p>I am working on a project with Quinn Painter, Daniel Muller and Kevin Burke. Quinn and Kevin are mainly working coding. Daniel is working on gun models and I am working on level design. We are making a Massive Multiplayer FPS.</p>

<p>./ What I want to achieve.
I want to learn how to code better. I want to also learn how to make level's look much better and I want to make better sounds and/or music.</p>

<p>Bruno Torres</p>
